ANSWERS:
Q1:
    One of the uses is mange user interface (gui) on one hand we want to draw on
    the screen different things in parallel. on the other hand, we might want that
    the threads will have convinenat acsses to program parameters as window size, font
    size and more.

Q2:
    the main advantage is that the tabs of the chorme compete on resourse as
    individual, so they get from the operating system more quantums.
    the main disadvantge, is that each thread get a single thread slice of RAM,
    so it makes the chorme application an hevaiy one, and
    might cause to starvetion of other application.

Q3:
    first, each time the user typing on keyborod, he raises a keyboard interupt SIGINT,
     and then the charters are insert into the shell input line, then after type enter,
      the shell call parser the command, and ask from the operating system to execute
        the kill command. the operating system frease the other threads and kill the
         the given process. finally the given program takes the command in order to
          execute final steps, as clean junk.. etc. and then just death.

Q4:
  SIGALRM is sent when real or clock time elapses.
  - for example, we might want to use SIGARLM in case we want to monitor
  how mach time in seconds the whole run occuer.
  SIGVTALRM is sent when CPU time used by the process elapses.
  - for example, we might want to use SIGVTALRM in case we want to mange
   how mach resource each inner thread will get from the main process.
